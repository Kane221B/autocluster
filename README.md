# Autocluster codebase
This the the codebase for prototypes used in the thought-piece "Re-imagining the instrument cluster in cars" written by ustwo. 
There are 3 prototypes in this repository representing:
1. An unbranded archetype of an instrument cluster
2. Reimagining the cluster of a Ferrari California
3. Reimagining the cluster of a Mercedes Benz S-class 

The primary tool used for building these has been FramerJS framework as found at http://framerjs.com/ and their realtime application Framer Studio.
