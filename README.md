# Autocluster codebase
This the the codebase for prototypes used in the thought-piece "Re-imagining the instrument cluster in cars" written by ustwo. 
There are 3 web based prototypes in this repository representing:
* An unbranded archetype of an instrument cluster
* Reimagining the cluster of a Ferrari California
* Reimagining the cluster of a Mercedes Benz S-class 
* Adaptive UI prototype - using headtracking as a basis for jusdging viewing angle.

## Tools
* The primary tool used for building these prototypes has been the FramerJS framework built for rapid prototyping and experimentation. This can be found at http://framerjs.com/ and their realtime application Framer Studio.

* Also used is PaperJS http://paperjs.org/ for vector graphics scripting.

* Headtrackr JS - which is a javascript library for real-time face tracking and head tracking, tracking the position of a users head in relation to the computer screen, via a web camera and the webRTC/getUserMedia standard. https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr/

Please feel free to comment on the prototypes and the codebase along with feeling free to riff and build on them if possible. Attribution to ustwo will be much appreciated.
